# MediaEval-2018
Predicting Media Memorability Task focuses on the problem of predicting how memorable a video will be [1]. This paper describes the approach developed to predict the short-term and long-term video memorability for the 2018 MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation. Predictions are scored between 0-1 where closer to 1 refers to videos being more memorable. The approach taken for this research is simple and understandable as it is based on finalising models, by comparing 3 algorithms shortlisted based on prior domain knowledge (text, aesthetic feature, video feature) subsequently selecting the one that suits our dataset, finally ensemble model is used to retrieve scores by using a weighted average approach.
